C-table
=======
A cube-like table, which allows containing column and row headers and some aggregating subtotals. still working.........
This component is based on **Angular** framework. We use reporting service and analyzor to generate reports on the server side. However, it's diffcult to interact with users for some specific purpose. By the convenience of binding data and DOM manipulations in Angular's world, I decide to develop this component with angular(also with jquery and underscore for the basement). There are still many functions not yet done (like click a cell to edit the content).

###Dependiencies
[Angular](http://https://angularjs.org/)<br>
[JQuery](http://jquery.com/)<br>
